1. Basic Instructions that i have followed to create this repository. ->
Created a new public repository and Named it to "my-first-repo."

Then i Cloned it to my local (Pc) using the Gitbash terminal. the command for cloning repository is ~ git clone https://github.com/hySumit/my-first-repo.git

Inside this repository i created another file called "hello.txt."

Added a greeting message (e.g., "Hello, GitHub!") to the "hello.txt" file. and Saved it.

2. Staging and Committing Changes ->
Used the git status command to check the status of the repository. and saw it was just created and not staged.

Used the git add .hello.txt command to stage the changes i have made to "hello.txt." file.

Again i used the git status command to verify that the changes are staged or not.

Used the git commit -m "Added greeting to hello.txt" command to commit the staged changes.

3. Pushing Changes to GitHub ->
Used the git push command to push my committed changes to my GitHub repository.

Visited my GitHub repository in a web browser and verified that the "hello.txt" file and my commit message are visible or not.

4. Creating a New Branch
Used the git branch feature/additional-greeting. command to create a new branch in the repository.

Used the git checkout feature/additional-greeting command to switch to that new branch.

Used the git branch command again to confirm that i am now on the new branch.

5. Modifying and committing and Pushing on a New Branch.
Added some new messages to the file that i have created called "hello.txt".

Again i have used git status , git add . , git commit to stage and commit the changes.

Used the git push -u origin feature/additional-greeting command to push the "feature/additional-greeting" branch to my GitHub repository.

6. Creating a Pull Request and Reviewing and Merging.
I came to my github repository and created a new pull Request it is very simple to created.

After all the review and inspection i merged the branch to the main branch.
